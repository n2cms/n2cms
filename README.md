## Welcome to N2CMS

**N2CMS is a lightweight CMS framework.** With just a few strokes of your keyboard a 
wonderful strongly-typed model emerges complete with a management UI. You can 
spend the rest of your day building the best site imaginable.

**It's so .NET!** With N2CMS, you build the model of the data that needs to be managed using C# or 
VB code in Visual Studio. The type below is picked up by the N2 engine at runtime 
and made available to be edited. The code uses an open API with multiple built-in 
options and unlimited customization options.

*All you have to do is design your model class (inherit N2.ContentItem) and define 
which properties are editable by adding attributes*

```csharp
[PageDefinition(TemplateUrl = "~/my/pageitemtemplate.aspx")]
public class PageItem : N2.ContentItem
{
    [EditableFreeTextArea]
    public virtual string Text { get; set; }
}
```

### Quick Start

**For a quick start**, follow these instructions, which assume that you are using ASP.NET MVC + Razor (the "Dinamico" template pack -- see below for details). 

1. Create a new, empty Web Application Project in Visual Studio 2012 or 2013. 
2. Go to *Tools > Library Package Manager > Package Manager Console*
3. In the Package Manager console run the following commands: 
  ```
Install-Package N2CMS.Dinamico
Install-Package N2CMS.Management
```

Please note, N2CMS supports the following ASP.NET view engines:
* ASP.NET MVC + Razor ("Dinamico" template pack)
* ASP.NET MVC + MVC Views ("MVC" template pack)
* ASP.NET Web Forms


Detailed installation instructions are available at: https://github.com/n2cms/n2cms/blob/master/README_SETUP.md
or in our documentation wiki: https://n2cmsdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/display/N2CMS/Getting+Started+using+N2CMS

##API

You can use the API within your methods and properties to develop advanced content manageable features.

```csharp
public void DoSomeStuffWithSomeItems(DateTime minDate, DateTime maxDate)
{
	IList<ContentItem> items = N2.Find.Items
		.Where.Created.Between(minDate, maxDate)
		.And.SavedBy.Eq("admin")
		.OrderBy.Published.Desc
		.Select();

	foreach (ContentItem item in items)
		DoSomethingWith(item);
}
```
There are more API usage examples here: http://n2cms.com/Documentation/Manipulating%20content/Finding%20content.aspx.

## Frequently Asked Questions

*What does the N2 in N2CMS stand for?*
It is short for "en tva" (1-2 in swedish).

*I want to create an open source project based on N2CMS.  I want N2CMS to be 
part of branding my project. Do you have guidance on naming my project?*

Yes, please use the entire project name "N2CMS" in your project name.  For 
example, N2CMS.BootstrapBlog would be great project name. We feel that just 
using "N2" is too generic.  Using N2CMS will help with organic search results.

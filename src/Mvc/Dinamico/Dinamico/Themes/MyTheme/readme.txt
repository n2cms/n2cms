Look at ../Default/. You can override content from Default by creating a new 
file at the same subpath below this folder.

You can extend existing "template-first" pages and parts by placing .cshtml files
in /Views/ContentPages and /Views/ContentParts respectively. 
Look at /Dinamico/Themes/Default/Views/Content[Pages|Parts] for inspiration.

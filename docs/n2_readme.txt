ABOUT N2 CMS

N2 is a lightweight CMS framework that helps you build great web sites that 
anyone can update. Web content editors will enjoy a simple and enpowering web 
interface while developers can benefit from a discoverable and programmer 
friendly API.

More information and documentation on the project web site: http://n2cms.com/


GETTING STARTED

The easiest option is probably downloading one of the examples or template 
packages. Examples contain very little code to show the development model.
Templates contain a more complex site you can use as a base or as reference.


INSTALLATION

* see install.txt


TEMPLATES

The templates are outward facing features that can be used out of the box. In
N2 CMS 2.0 there are two sets of templates. 

* MVC Templates
  The new templates built with ASP.NET MVC technology (contributed by Steve).
* (WebForms) Templates
  The original templates built with WebForms.


EXAMPLES

There are a bunch of examples in the Examples "examples" directory of the 
source code package. To run them you need to copy the compiled output of the
core project and the edit interface into the example's web roots. 
Prepare_AllDependencies.bat should do this for you. The examples:

* MVC
  Example using the ASP.NET MVC framework
* MinimalVisualBasic
  Very simple web site in Visual Basic. This project includes the least amount 
  of noise for grasping the development model
* MinimalCSharp
  Very simple web site in C#. This project includes the least amount of noise 
  for grasping the basic model
